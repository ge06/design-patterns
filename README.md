<h2> Software Design Pattern </h2>

<blockquote>
    <b>
“Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice” (Alexander et al. 1977, p x).

    <p >
    Patterns are general solutions to recurring problems. They also have the benefit of being well tested by lots of developers. So, when you see a need for one, you can sleep well knowing many developers have been there before and solved the problem using similar techniques.
    Design patterns had originally been categorized into the following 3 sub-classifications based on kind of problem they solve.

    <ul>
<li>
            Creational Patterns
</li>
<ol>
<li>
Creational patterns provide the capability to create objects based on a required criterion and in a controlled way. They deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

            Structural Patterns 
</li>
<ol>
<li>
Structural patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. They ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities.
</li>

            Behavioral Patterns
</li>
<ol>
<li>
Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. They identify common communication patterns among objects and distribute responsibility. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication.</li>
